		"description": "In classification, class imbalance is a factor that degrades the classification performance of many classification methods. We have studied *resampling* (over- and under-sampling) and *metric learning* for the class imbalance problem. Resampling is one widely accepted approach to the class imbalance, and metric learning is another approach to deal with *insufficient feature space* problem. In addition, since metric learning methods also suffer from the class imbalance problem, we have studied the combination of resampling and metric learning."

		"description": "Semi-structured data such as XML data have been widely used in various situations in order to reuse information not only in the services but also external applications. Utilizing such semi-structured data is an important challenge, and this research particularly focuses on the exploration over semi-structured data. Faceted search is one of the widely accepted exploratory search methods, therefore, this research applies faceted search to semi-structured data. In order to construct a faceted search system, this research works on four directions: (1) a framework to construct a faceted search system over XML data which is a tree-structured semi-structured data, (2) the extended framework for graph-structured semi-structured data, (3) an automation scheme for extracting facet information from texts, and (4) utilization of textual contents in semi-structured data."
